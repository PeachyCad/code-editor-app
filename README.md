# code-editor-app
This is a simple code editor application for C/C++ like languages.

You have an opportunity to use default browser version or to work with form application. Importing Awesomium (browser for C# form application) was based on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldnfrm-ZObE, https://codedocu.com/Details_mobile?d=1767&z=1&t=Alternative+Web+Browser+Control%3A+Awesomium. JS code-editor API was used from here: https://codemirror.net.
